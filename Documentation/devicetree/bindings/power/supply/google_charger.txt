~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Required properties:
 - compatible : "google,charger"
 - google,chg-power-supply: name of the charge control power supply
 - google,bat-power-supply: name of the Fuel Gauge power supply
 - google,chg-update-interval: delay in ms to wait before re-running the work
     item
 - google,chg-battery-capacity: the nominal capacity used to compute the
     effective 1C charge rate
 - google,chg-temp-limits: the temperature buckets limits defining the indexes
     of the constant charge limits (row index in google,chg-cc-limits)
 - google,chg-cv-limits: steps voltage limits (column index in
     google,chg-cc-limits)
 - google,chg-cc-limits: the array of constant current charge rates given in %
     of google,chg-battery-capacity

Optional properties:
 - google,wlc-power-supply: name of wireless charing input power supply
 - google,cv-hw-resolution: the constant voltage setting resolution in micro
     volt defaults to 25000
 - google,cc-hw-resolution: the constant current setting resolution in micro amp
     defaults to 25000
 - google,cv-range-accuracy: the voltage margin in micro volt used at taper to
     determine whether battery voltage should be raised in an attempt to match
     tier voltage for ir drop compensation. Defaults to cv-hw-resolution / 2.
 - google,cv-debounce-cnt: the number of cv-update-interval to wait after
     entering taper or after raising charging voltage for ir drop compensation
     before a new attempt. Defaults to 3 (eg 6 seconds for default
     cv-update-interval).
 - google,cv-update-interval: delay in ms to wait before re-running the work
     item while in taper. Defaults to 2000 (2 seconds)
 - google,cv-tier-ov-delay: the number of cv-update-interval to wait (penalty)
     during ir drop compensation before a new attempt to raise voltage when
     battery voltage is found above tier limit. Defaults to 10 cycles (20
     seconds for default cv-update-interval).
 - google,chg-tolerance: the deci-percent tolerance we need to give the PMIC to
     ensure actual current is below chg-cc-limits (divide by 10 to get
     percentage points). Max allowed tolerance is 25%.
- google,fv-uv-margin-dpct: the deci-percent margin on vtier that charger float
     voltage must not exceed when calculating target voltage during IRDROP
     compensation. Default 0 (disabled), set to 1030 for 3%.
- google,cv-tier-switch-cnt: the number of consecutive poll cyles with current
     under next tier that are needed before switching charge tier.
     Default 3 poll cycles.
