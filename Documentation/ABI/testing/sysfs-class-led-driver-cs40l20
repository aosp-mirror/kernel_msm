What:		/sys/class/leds/vibrator/device/redc_measured
Date:		Jan 2018
KernelVersion:	4.9
Contact:	David Lin <dtwlin@google.com>
Description:
		Reading it to obtain the resistence DC measured in Q7.17
		format. It must be scaled by 5.687 as shown in the following
		example:

		$ cat /sys/class/leds/vibrator/device/redc_measured

		ReDC (Ohms) = redc_measured / 2^17 * 5.687
